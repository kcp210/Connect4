# Connect4

The only files needed for this Networking/Threading Delivarable are 
Conenct4Client, core.Connect4Server, and core.Connect4Constants. All other files
are from previous deliverables for the game without networking. 

Run the core.Connect4Server file first, then run as many core.Connect4Client 
files as needed for desired gameplay.
